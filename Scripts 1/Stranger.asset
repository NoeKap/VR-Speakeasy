  - "You mispronounced word and friends do not correct you \r\n\r\nYou: ... \u201CTank
    you\u201D \r\n\r\nStranger1: \u201CIt is Thhhh_ank you not Tank you... Learn
    proper English\u201D \r\n\nStranger 1 to Stranger 2: \u201COmg they are new to
    the country; they need to learn some proper English... how are you going to immigrate
    to a new country without knowing their primary language? I couldn\u2019t understand
    a single word that came out of their mouth\u201D \r\n\r\nStranger 2 to Stranger
    1: \u201COr they should just go back to their country. They\u2019re going to
    have a hard time learning English AND keep up with their classes. Ha! I wouldn\u2019t
    want to be them or the teacher teaching them.\u201D "
  - Conversation ends and you walk away.
  - "You: \u201CDo you speak another language? No? At least this is my second language...
    Also, when you go on vacation to a non-English speaking country you do not even
    try and locals help you out, why can\u2019t you have some tolerance towards me?\u201D
    \r\n\r\nStrangers: *Too stunned to speak* \r\n\r\nConversation ends "
  - "You: \u201CYou let me go 3 months without correcting the way I say thank you??\u201D
    \r\n\r\nFriend: \u201CI did not want to make you feel bad\u201D \r\n\r\nYou:
    \u201CWell, I mean if you let me know without making fun of me it is definitely
    better than going through what I just went through. I can\u2019t imagine how
    much words I didn\u2019t say correctly. \u201D \r\n\r\nFriend: \u201COkay first
    off, it\u2019s many words not much. *He chuckles* Let\u2019s find you an English/French
    class for you to attend and you get better. Just know everybody went through
    it and it\u2019s not your first language so don\u2019t worry about what they
    will say about you. Your opinion on how you handle this situation is the only
    one that matters. You got this.\u201D \r\n\r\nConversation ends"
